                                    <h3>Ecohydrology</h3>
                                    <p> <i> Do you know how water flows up a tree? </i> </p>
                                    <p>
                                        Ecohydrology is the study of plant (eco) water (hydrology) 
                                        interactions from the global to the leaf scale. 
                                        The reason water is able to flow against gravity up a tree
                                        is the same reason a puddle will evaporate from a liquid to water vapor. 
                                        The atmosphere is relatively dry (even on humid days) and acts like a sponge
                                        pulling the water out from the leaves. When the water is sucked out 
                                        of the leaves it acts like a rope pulling up on the water in the rest of the tree 
                                        down to the roots, which ultimately suck water from the soil. The drier the soil is 
                                        the more tension is required to pull it up. When water is under tension like this its pressure is negative.
                                        A negative pressure means that if exposed to the atmosphere it would instantly boil! The reason
                                        the trees are able to stop water from spontaneously boiling at negative pressures is still not 
                                        well understood and an active area of research.
                                    </p>

                                        So far my work has been on models of stomata -- the tiny mouths on the leaves of plants that open
                                        to allow CO2 to diffuse in. When stomata open water can escape however, which means a plant will not 
                                        want to keep stomata open for longer than it needs to. Collectively, stomata act as a critical valve
                                        for both the carbon and water cycles. Thus understanding them and when and why they open is critical. 
                                        In this <a  target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://doi.org/10.1111/nph.20035">paper</a> I develop an optimization theory that 
                                        explains mathematically why 'optimal' stomatal behavior is coupled to a plant's resilience to water stress. 
                                        I also demonstrate an intuitive but previously unquantified idea, that it is optimal for plant resistance to water
                                        stress to increase with aridity.

                                    <h3>Geochemical Cycles</h3>
                                    <p>
                                        Simple, non-dimensional models can be hugely important for understanding 
                                        complex and multivariate environmental phenomena like nutrient cycles in the soil. 
                                        Plants need nutrients (the big ones are nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium) to 
                                        perform vital functions. A lack of nutrients can limit agricultural productivity. 
                                        The soil, however, is highly complex and each nutrient can exist in a variety of 
                                        compounds and redox states. Nitrogen for instance, can range from having plus four electrons
                                        in nitrate to having minus three electrons in ammonia! The transitions between states 
                                        are spontaneous due to favorable conditions or are mediated by organisms, usually 
                                        bacteria. A good example is nitrogen fixing bacteria which provide natural nitrogen fertilization
                                        for plants by converting nitrogen gas (N2), which is abundant in the atmosphere, to ammonia, a form 
                                        of nitrogen that is available for plant uptake.

                                        A much less studied soil chemical cycle is the iron cycle, a micro nutrient for plants. The iron cycle 
                                        is significant not only as a nutrient but also for its varied interactions with soil organic carbon (SOC). 
                                        SOC is a major store of carbon that can serve as a sink of CO2, or a source. The lifetime of SOC in the soil 
                                        can vary from days to millenia and has major ramifications for the rate of climate change. Iron is hugely important 
                                        because in its mineral form (Fe3) it 'protects' SOC that latches on from being decomposed back into CO2. However,
                                        when the soil is flooded Fe3 can be reduced to Fe2, which (1) releases the protected carbon and (2) serves as an oxidizing 
                                        agent for further production of CO2. Thus, the effect that iron has on the carbon cycle is complex and depends on soil 
                                        moisture fluctations. I wrote my 
                                        <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="texts/Thesis_Final_aidanjm2024.pdf">thesis</a>
                                         on modeling the soil iron cycle and its interactions with the carbon cycle. The main conclusions were: (1) an analytical 
                                         solution to a stochastic differential equation which solves for what fraction of the time iron is in its Fe2 vs Fe3 state 
                                         given a few parameters (rate of oxidation, average rainfall...); and (2) that rewetting previously drained wetlands (seen as 
                                         generally a good thing) can lead to increased rates of carbon emissions by reducing the iron from Fe3 to Fe2 and releasing the 
                                         attached SOC.

                                    <h3>Land-Atmosphere Interactions</h3>
                                    <p>
                                        Land, known far and wide as the bottom boundary condition, interacts with the atmosphere to determine 
                                        the temperature and humidity that plants and animals feel. The atmospheric boundary layer (ABL) is the bottom 
                                        layer of the atmosphere going from surface level to several kilometers. During the day is defined by turbulent mixing and 
                                        grows in height as the day progressess and more heat is transfered from the ground to the air. Heat can be transferred in 
                                        from the ground to the air as radiation, sensible heat, and latent heat. Latent heat is just the energy that is released when 
                                        water evaporates. In other words, the evaporation of water does not just affect the water cycle but is also critical for the earth's energy balance. 
                                        About 2/3 of land evaporation comes from plants (called transpiration), but plants are able to control 
                                        when they evaporate using their stomata (we are back to ecoyhdrology!). Plants, as well as ice, different colored rocks, and 
                                        human land use change can all affect the land surface in several ways. First, it can change the albedo (reflectiveness) of surfaces
                                        which can change how much radiation is absorbed by the land. Asphalt is always hot in the summer because its black and has a low albedo, meaning
                                        it absorbs much more light than it reflects. Another way land properties affect the atmosphere is through surface roughness. Grasses, 
                                        corn fields, towns, sky scrapers, and mountains all introduce roughness into the path of wind and change the dynamics in the lower atmosphere. 
                                    </p>

                                        Feedback cycles can occur in the land-plant-atmosphere system. For instance rainforests have dense vegetation that is incredibly efficient at evaporating 
                                        water compared to bare soil. This means that more water is put back into the atmosphere when it rains over the Amazon. More water in the atmosphere 
                                        increases the rate of precipitation, which promotes the growth of dense vegetation. You can read more about it  
                                        <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://doi.org/10.1038/ncomms14681">here</a>. This feedback also means 
                                        that disrupting the cycle, i.e. deforestation, will disrupt the feedback loop and lead to amplified droughts and deforestation. As an undergraduate
                                        I developed a coupled model of the plant-atmosphere system using a simplified boundary layer model for the atmosphere and the Photo3 model
                                        for plants. I found that CAM plants (e.g. succulents/cacti) can significantly alter the energy and water conditions of the ABL because they transpire at night, 
                                        rather than during the day. The code for that project can be found

                                Aidan has several years of tutoring and mentoring experience for a variety of STEM topics. 
                                He was a tutor for two years at the McGraw Center for teaching and 
                                learning at Princeton University where he taught multivariable calculus, physics, and data analysis in R.  

                                Aidan enjoys teaching math and science at all levels (up to his own limit of knowledge?). 
                                He is also available for SAT/ACT prep and general college/graduate school advice.
